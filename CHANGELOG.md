## Unreleased

### Pi: DeepSeek and the ChatGPT subscription (EPIC #127)

- `provider: pi` runs any phase through [Pi](docs/pi.md) 1.0.0 or newer, an
  optional multi-model provider: on a DeepSeek API key, its first target,
  or on the ChatGPT sign-in you made in Pi yourself, with no OpenAI
  Platform API key in AutoForge's environment. The RPC adapter, read-only
  `doctor` checks and a per-launch auth check, and the unattended loading
  policy ([ADR 0003](docs/adr/0003-pi-agent-provider.md),
  [Pi policy](docs/pi-policy.md); #129 to #133). It is opt-in per profile:
  every default profile still runs Claude Code or OpenCode.
- The [Pi operator guide](docs/pi.md) (#135): installing Pi and giving it a
  credential yourself, a DeepSeek profile (`deepseek/deepseek-flash`,
  `require_oauth: false`, the key in Pi's store or forwarded with the
  global `execution.env_allowlist_extra`, a dedicated `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR`
  under the sandbox) and a ChatGPT one to copy, model and thinking-level
  choices, subscription versus API key, each `doctor` Pi row with its
  remedy, security, LOCAL mode, limitations and unattended use.
- `doctor`'s Pi auth row on an API key now reads
  `authType api_key; authenticated ...`: with a `:` there, the redaction
  `doctor` prints through masked the word `authenticated`.
- `doctor` gains a row for Pi profiles, `pi's detached tool processes are
  contained`: OK where the controller can make itself a child subreaper
  (Linux), a warning elsewhere, including a Linux host whose security
  policy denies it. There a process a Pi tool command backgrounds can
  outlive the launch and Pi is attended only (#135). A warning, never a
  failure.
- An opt-in live smoke test, `tests/test_live_pi.py` (#135): one LOCAL
  REVIEW through your own Pi and credential, on the route you name with
  `AUTOFORGE_LIVE_PI_AUTH`: `api_key` (DeepSeek by default) or `oauth` (the
  ChatGPT sign-in, optional), then a credential scan of everything
  AutoForge wrote and checks for left-behind sessions and processes; its
  report names the AutoForge commit, the route and the `authType`. It is
  marked `live` and deselected by default, so `make check` and CI do not
  run it; it needs `-m live` and `AUTOFORGE_LIVE_PI=1`
  ([Development](docs/development.md#the-live-pi-smoke-test)).
