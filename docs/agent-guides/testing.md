# Testing expectations

Read this before adding or changing tests, or before changing behaviour in an
area listed under "High-priority coverage" (each such change must come with
the corresponding test). The test-scope conventions (fakes, fixtures and what
a test may never do) are in `tests/AGENTS.md`; this document is the coverage
contract.

---

## Testing requirements

Every behavioral change should include or update automated tests.

Do not call real Claude Code/OpenCode/GitHub write APIs from unit tests.

Use mocks, fakes, fixtures, and scripted providers.

High-priority coverage includes:

### State

- serialization/deserialization
- atomic persistence
- corrupt-state handling
- idempotent merge counting

### Transitions

- every legal transition
- illegal transitions

### Routing

- review round 1
- review round 2
- review round 5
- review round 6+

### CONTROL_RESULT

- valid result
- multiple blocks
- malformed JSON
- missing/incomplete markers
- wrong phase
- missing fields
- review invariant mismatch

### Execution

- success
- non-zero exit
- timeout, including a descendant that holds the inherited pipes after the
  child has exited (inside the process group, and outside it via `setsid`),
  a same-group descendant that closed its stdio and ignores SIGTERM, and a
  direct child that survives SIGKILL (the kill neutered), which is abandoned
  after the grace rather than waited for
- bounded capture: a stream past the bound keeps its head and tail, the
  retained size honours a bound smaller than one pipe read, and memory stays
  at the bound plus a constant under one-byte reads
- non-UTF-8 output is replaced, not raised; a multi-byte character across
  the internal head/tail split is intact when nothing was omitted
- arguments containing shell metacharacters
- the allow-listed environment: an exact name and a `PREFIX*` select from
  the controller's environment, an absent name adds no placeholder, an
  invalid entry refuses to launch, no allow-list inherits everything, and
  an explicit `env` is layered over the selection

### Agent isolation (REMOTE)

- the agent's cwd is the per-issue worktree under the git common dir (or
  `execution.worktree_dir`), detached at the checkout's HEAD, without the
  operator's uncommitted work or `.autoforge/`; it is reused across phases
  as the agent left it
- a path that exists but is not a worktree root of this repository, or a
  location inside the operator's working tree, is refused, not adopted
- a dry run creates no worktree and runs no git
- the agent request and the run log carry the configured allow-list; pre-merge
  and validation commands run under the same one
- HEAD or branch of the operator's checkout changing while the agent ran
  enters BLOCKED (also when the invocation itself failed); agent commits in
  its own worktree are not drift

### GitHub verification

- valid PR
- missing PR
- HEAD mismatch
- comment verification
- follow-up issue verification

### Recovery

- external side effect completed before state write
- resume without duplicating work

### Integration

Maintain a fake/scripted-provider loop that can exercise:

```text
INITIALIZING
-> ANALYZE_EXECUTE
-> REVIEW (findings)
-> FIX
-> REVIEW (clean)
-> READY_FOR_MERGE
```

without external writes.
