# Testing expectations

Read this before adding or changing tests, or before changing behaviour in an
area listed under "High-priority coverage" (each such change must come with
the corresponding test). The test-scope conventions (fakes, fixtures and what
a test may never do) are in `tests/AGENTS.md`; this document is the coverage
contract.

---

## Testing requirements

Every behavioral change should include or update automated tests.

Do not call real Claude Code/OpenCode/GitHub write APIs from unit tests.

Use mocks, fakes, fixtures, and scripted providers.

High-priority coverage includes:

### State

- serialization/deserialization
- atomic persistence
- corrupt-state handling
- idempotent merge counting

### Transitions

- every legal transition
- illegal transitions

### Routing

- review round 1
- review round 2
- review round 5
- review round 6+

### CONTROL_RESULT

- valid result
- multiple blocks
- malformed JSON
- missing/incomplete markers
- wrong phase
- missing fields
- review invariant mismatch

### Execution

- success
- non-zero exit
- timeout, including a descendant that holds the inherited pipes after the
  child has exited (inside the process group, and outside it via `setsid`),
  and a same-group descendant that closed its stdio and ignores SIGTERM
- bounded capture: a stream past the bound keeps its head and tail, the
  retained size honours a bound smaller than one pipe read, and memory stays
  at the bound plus a constant under one-byte reads
- non-UTF-8 output is replaced, not raised; a multi-byte character across
  the internal head/tail split is intact when nothing was omitted
- arguments containing shell metacharacters

### GitHub verification

- valid PR
- missing PR
- HEAD mismatch
- comment verification
- follow-up issue verification

### Recovery

- external side effect completed before state write
- resume without duplicating work

### Integration

Maintain a fake/scripted-provider loop that can exercise:

```text
INITIALIZING
-> ANALYZE_EXECUTE
-> REVIEW (findings)
-> FIX
-> REVIEW (clean)
-> READY_FOR_MERGE
```

without external writes.
